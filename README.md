# Backup Policy

A backup policy is a set of guidelines and procedures for creating and managing backups of data, systems, or applications. The policy typically includes information about what data needs to be backed up, how often backups should be performed, where backups should be stored, how long backups should be retained, and who is responsible for managing the backup process.

The purpose of a backup policy is to ensure that critical data and systems can be restored in the event of a disaster or data loss. A backup policy helps to minimize the risk of data loss and downtime by providing a framework for regular backups and proper storage of backup data.
